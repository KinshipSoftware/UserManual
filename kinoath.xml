            <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">KinOath Kinship Archiver is a kinship application designed,
              first of all, to link kinship data with archived data such as, for example, media
              resources (i.e. audio files, video files, etc.). Secondly, being culturally
              nonspecific, this program makes it possible for users to create diagrams based on
              culturally, and therefore linguistically, different social structures; such diagrams
              can then be compared and contrasted. A series of options are included which aim to
              optimize graphical representation of the data, a key feature within KinOath
              environment. </td>

        >http://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/kinoath</ulink>. You can either start it - with no
      installation needed - through the option <emphasis role="bold">Run via webstart</emphasis>, or
      you can install it on your computer by selecting one of the installers provided next to "Run
      via webstart". In both cases you will need Java installed on your machine for the application
      to run. For more information on Java and how to install it go to <ulink

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">New (default diagram)</emphasis>: this option allows you to
              open a new diagram. It says "<emphasis role="italic">default</emphasis> diagram"
              because when KinOath opens it shows the diagram that was previously set as default
              through the option "Set Default Diagram as" (see below). </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">New Diagram of Type</emphasis>: this option allows you to

              new diagram file choosing from the ones present in your computer directories. Once you
              have selected a file this will open in a new page of KinOath. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Open Recent Diagram</emphasis>: through this option you can
              select and re-open one of the diagrams which were previously opened. If you want to
              delete the list of diagrams opened you can select <emphasis role="bold">Clear
                list</emphasis>. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Open Sample Diagram</emphasis>: KinOath includes a number of
              sample diagrams through which you can observe how the application works (see section
              2.1.2.). You can open and examine these sample diagrams by selecting this option. </para>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Import Gedcom / CSV File</emphasis>: this option allows you
              to import kinship files in either Gedcom or CSV format. Once it is selected a window
              will open asking you to choose the file to import from a directory; the file selected
              will then open in a new page of KinOath.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Import Sample Data</emphasis>: some of the diagrams require
              data to be imported before starting to work on them. A list of sample data is
              accessible via this option. Once the import is complete a new panel will appear
              containing all the entities imported (<emphasis role="bold">Imported
                Entities</emphasis>).</para>

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Export as PDF/JPEG/PNG/TIFF</emphasis>: this option allows
              you to export files (in one of the following formats: PDF, JPEG, PNG and TIFF) to a
              directory in your computer. As in the previous option, "Save as", when selecting
              "Export as ..." you will be asked to choose a directory and a file name plus, in this
              case, a file format. </para>

            <para><emphasis role="bold">Export for R / SPSS</emphasis>: this option allows you to
              export a KinOath diagram to either R or SPSS, two programs you can use mainly to
              statistically analyse your data. The file format is, by deafult, <emphasis

            <para><emphasis role="bold">Set Default Diagram as</emphasis>: through this option you
              can take a certain type of diagram and some diagram settings, and set them as default,
              so that when you start the application again, this will open showing the specific
              diagram and settings you preconfigured. Example: open a new standard diagram, open the
              diagram settings panel, choose the relation type definitions tab, fill in the colomns
              there (e.g. relation type: sibling, line colour: pink, line width: 5). Set it as
              default diagram. Open a new default diagram and create two individuals: if you select
              one of them, it will already show you the sibling relation, represented by a spot of
              the colour you previously chose for that relation type. See picture below. </para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis role="bold">Standard Diagram (database driven)</emphasis>: when
                selecting this type, a new page of KinOath Kinship Archiver will open, with a
                central, blank panel and a smaller panel on the left which includes three tabs:
                  <emphasis role="bold">Search Entities</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Project
                  Tree</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Diagram Tree</emphasis>. Through the
                first one you can search for entities which are already present in the database . A
                complete list of the latter is provided in the second tab. In the third tab, by
                contrast, you are able to see the specific entities you have selected from the
                database and/or the ones you have created. Speaking about new entities, you can
                create a completely new diagram from scratch using the several options of the menu
                that comes out when right clicking in the main panel:<orderedlist>
                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Add</emphasis>: you may decide to add an <emphasis

                        >Chromosome_Example</emphasis>, or any other entity type selected in the
                      profiles settings, to your diagram. In both cases, a new entity will appear,
                      represented by a small square icon (unless configured otherwise). If you
                      select that entity you will see, at the bottom of the page, a table with
                      information to fill in: <emphasis role="bold">Name</emphasis>, <emphasis
                        role="bold">Date of Birth</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Date of
                        Death</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Gender</emphasis> (in the case of
                      the chromosome example you will also see the field <emphasis role="bold"
                        >Chromosome</emphasis>, where chromosome data can be entered). Once the data
                      regarding an entity has been entered you can save it either by clicking on the
                      entity itself, or by choosing - from the right click menu - the option
                        <emphasis role="bold">Save All Data Changes</emphasis>.</para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Add Geometry</emphasis>: its sub-options are:

                        Circle</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Add Square</emphasis>, <emphasis

                        Ellipse</emphasis>. The first (label) allows you to enter a label for your
                      diagram, and you can do it by entering the text into a small window opening at
                      the bottom of the page when the option is selected. The other four are graphic
                      options you can use to differentiate kin groups (circle, square, ellipse) or
                      to link the entities with more than one single line (polyline) [Note: polyline
                      is not an available option at the moment]. </para>

                      pieces of information but, at a certain moment, you discover that they are the
                      same individual, and therefore you want to make them merge into a single
                      entity. What results from the merger is a single individual carrying the
                      information of the two merged entities. [Note: at the moment it only merges
                      the entities but not the kinship data that such entities carry]</para>

                      entities have been created, you may also want to create relations between
                      them. To this purpose, select how many entities you need (by clicking on them
                      while holding down the SHIFT button on the keyboard) and right click. You can
                      choose between: <emphasis role="bold">sibling</emphasis>, <emphasis
                        role="bold">ancestor</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"
                      >descendant</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">union</emphasis>, <emphasis
                        role="bold">kinterm</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">other</emphasis> (the
                      last one means that the relation connecting two, or more, entities, is not a
                      sanguine relation). In addition, if you want to add only a relation of the
                      type "descendant" or "ancestor", you can simply select one entity and drag the
                      blue line to the other. [Note: as for these two last options, the choice of
                      one or the other depends on which entity you select first. In other words: if
                      you select the parent first, then you have to use the descendant relation,
                      whereas if you select the child first, you will have to choose the ancestor
                      relation.]</para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Remove Relations</emphasis>: you may also want to
                      change some of the relations created. To do so, select the necessary entities,
                      right click, and choose "Remove Relations" > <emphasis role="bold">Remove
                        relations between selected</emphasis>.</para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Set as ego (list will be cleared)</emphasis>: in the
                      "Diagram Tree" panel on the left of the page you see three lists: <emphasis
                        role="bold">Ego</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Required</emphasis>, and
                        <emphasis role="bold">Implied</emphasis>. When you create new entities they
                      automatically go under the "Required" list or, depending on the relations that
                      have been created, under the "Implied" list. However, if you want to create an
                      egocentric diagram you can select one of the entities and - through "Set as
                      ego (list will be cleared)" - transfer it to the "Ego" list. Such entity will
                      go black. [You can also create socialcentric diagrams, in which no particular
                      entity is set as starting point of the diagram.] The option contains the words
                      "list will be cleared", which means that through this command, only one entity
                      can be set as the reference-ego in one diagram; to add more egos, because many
                      diagrams may have been created, you need to use "Add to ego list" (see
                      below).</para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Add to ego list</emphasis>: this option is similar
                      to the previous one. You can select entities and add them to the "Ego" list in
                      the "Diagram Tree" panel on the left of the page.</para>

                Also here you can create diagrams from scratch but the difference from the previous
                case is that you need to enter strings in the panel on the top of the page, using
                precise kin types definitions. Hereinafter there is a list of the principal ones
                (which can be also found following the path: "Panels" > "Diagram Settings" > "Kin
                Type Definitions"):</para>

              <para>Besides the mere kin type definitions, however, you can also add labels to the
                entities, such as names and dates. To do so, you have first to enter a colon after
                the kin type definition and then the label(s). Different labels belonging to the
                same entity need to be separated by a semi-colon. Another colon goes after the last
                label and before the (if any) following kin type definition (see figure below). </para>

              <para><emphasis role="bold">Kin Terms Diagram</emphasis>: this type of diagram is
                useful when you want to observe how social relations develop and are named within a
                given language and culture. When you choose this diagram a new page of KinOath
                Kinship Archiver opens, with a central, blank panel, and a smaller panel on the
                right called <emphasis role="bold">Kin Term Group</emphasis>. In the latter, you can
                see a table that has to be filled in order to create the diagram: in the first
                column (<emphasis role="bold">Kin Term</emphasis>) you have to enter, as the name
                itself says, the kin terms that will represent also the labels of the entities in
                the diagram; in the second column (<emphasis role="bold">Referent Kin Type
                  Strings</emphasis>) you have to enter, for each kin term, its corresponding
                definition, i.e. the letters listed in the "Freeform Diagram" paragraph; in the
                fourth column (<emphasis role="bold">Description</emphasis>) you can add, for
                example, an English gloss if the kin terms entered are in another language. In
                addition, you can decide to: a) show the kin terms on the diagram, or hide them, by
                checking or unckecking the option <emphasis role="bold">Show on graph</emphasis>,
                above the table; b) delete some of the kin terms entered in the table by checking
                them and then clicking on <emphasis role="bold">Delete Selected</emphasis>, or c)
                delete the entire kin terms group by simply clicking on <emphasis role="bold">Delete
                  Group</emphasis>, on the left of "Delete Selected". Next to 'Show on graph', there
                is the option <emphasis role="bold">Generate Example Entities</emphasis>; it is
                checked by default and, if you uncheck it, the diagram will not be created. However,
                you can still create a diagram through the kin type strings panel from the panel
                menu. [Note: a further option is available, <emphasis role="bold">Propositus Kin
                  Type Strings</emphasis>, which has to do with the fact that in some cultures, and
                therefore in some languages, A talks with B about C with different terms, according
                to the relation existing between B and C. Anyway, for this first version of KinOath
                this option will be hidden.]</para>

              standard and the query diagram, which are both database driven. Indeed, its function

              click on <emphasis role="bold">Search</emphasis>. You can also search for related
