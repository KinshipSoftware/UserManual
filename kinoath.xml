              link kinship data with archived data such as, for example, media resources (i.e. audio
              files, video files, etc.). Secondly, being culturally nonspecific, this program makes
              it possible for users to create diagrams based on culturally, and therefore
              linguistically, different social structures; such diagrams can then be compared and
              contrasted. A series of options is included which aim to optimize graphical
              representation of the data, a key word within KinOath environment.   </td>

            <para><emphasis role="bold">New (default diagram)</emphasis>: this option allows you to
              open a new diagram. It says "<emphasis role="italic">default</emphasis> diagram"
              because when KinOath opens it shows the diagram that was previously set as default
              diagram through the option "Set Default Diagram as" (see below). </para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis role="bold">Standard Diagram (database driven)</emphasis>: when
                selecting this type, a new page of KinOath will open, with a central, blank panel
                and a smaller panel on the left which includes three tabs: <emphasis role="bold"
                  >Search Entities</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Project Tree</emphasis> and
                  <emphasis role="bold">Diagram Tree</emphasis>. Through the first one you can
                search for entities which are already present in the database. A complete list of
                the latter is provided in the second tab. In the third tab, by contrast, you are
                able to see the specific entities you have selected from the database and/or the
                ones you have created. Talking about new entities, you can create a completely new
                diagram from scratch using the several options of the menu that comes out when right
                clicking in the main panel:<orderedlist>
                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Add</emphasis>: you may decide to add an <emphasis
                        role="bold">Individual</emphasis> or a <emphasis role="bold"
                        >Chromosome_Example</emphasis> to your diagram. In both cases, a new entity
                      will appear under the form of a small square, representing an unspecified ego.
                      If you select that entity you will see, at the bottom of the page, a table
                      with information to fill in: <emphasis role="bold">Name</emphasis>, <emphasis
                        role="bold">Date of Birth</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Date of
                        Death</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Gender</emphasis> (in the case of
                      the chromosome example you will also see the voice <emphasis role="bold"
                        >Chromosome</emphasis>). Once the data regarding an ego have been entered
                      you can save them either by clicking on the ego itself, or by choosing - from
                      the right click menu - the option <emphasis role="bold">Save All Data
                        Changes</emphasis>.</para>

                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Add Geometry</emphasis>: its sub-options are:

                        Circle</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Add Square</emphasis>, <emphasis

                        Ellipse</emphasis>. The first (label) allows you to enter a label for your
                      diagram, and you can do it by entering the text into a small window opening at
                      the bottom of the page when the option is selected. The other four are graphic
                      options you can use to differentiate kin groups (circle, square, ellipse) or
                      to link the entities with more than one single line (polyline). </para>

                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Delete</emphasis>: this option allows you to delete
                      the entities you have taken from the database or created from scratch both
                      from the diagram and from the database. </para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Merge Selected Entities</emphasis>: you can use this
                      option when, for example, you have two separate entities carrying different
                      pieces of information but, at a certain moment, you discover that they are the
                      same individual, and therefore you want to make them merge into a single
                      entity. What results from the merger is a single individual carrying, though,
                      the information of the two merged entities. </para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Duplicate Selected Entities</emphasis>: when
                      choosing this option, the entity/ies previously selected will be doubled.

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Add Relations</emphasis>: once that several, single
                      entities have been created you may want to create also relations between them.
                      To this purpose, select how many entities you need (by clicking on them while
                      holding down the SHIFT button on the keyboard) and right click. You can choose
                      between: <emphasis role="bold">sibling</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"
                        >ancestor</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">descendant</emphasis>, <emphasis
                        role="bold">union</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">kinterm</emphasis>,
                        <emphasis role="bold">other</emphasis> (the last one means that the relation
                      connecting two, or more, entities, is not a sanguine relation). In addition,
                      if you want to add only a relation of the type "descendant" or "ancestor", you
                      can simply select one entity and drag the blue line to the other. [Note: as
                      for these two last options, the choice of one or the other depends on which
                      entity you select first. In other words: if you select the parent first, then
                      you have to use a descendant relation, whereas if you select the child first,
                      you will have to choose the ancestor relation]</para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Remove Relations</emphasis>: you may also want to
                      change some of the relations created. To do so, select the necessary entities,
                      right click, and choose "Remove Relations" > <emphasis role="bold">Remove
                        relations between selected</emphasis>.</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Set as ego (list will be cleared)</emphasis>: in the
                      "Diagram Tree" panel on the left of the page you see three lists: <emphasis
                        role="bold">Ego</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Required</emphasis>, and
                        <emphasis role="bold">Implied</emphasis>. When you create new entities they
                      automatically go under the "Required" list or, depending on the relations that
                      have been created, under the "Implied" list. However, if you want to create an
                      egocentric diagram you can select one of the entities and - through "Set as
                      ego (list will be cleared)" - transfer it to the "Ego" list. Such entity will
                      go black. [You can also create socialcentric diagrams, in which no particular
                      entity is set as starting point of the diagram.] The option contains the words
                      "list will be cleared", which means that through this command, only one entity
                      can be set as the reference-ego in one diagram; to add more you need to use
                      "Add to ego list" (see below).</para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Add to ego list</emphasis>: this option is similar
                      to the previous one. You can select entities and add them to the "Ego" list in
                      the "Diagram Tree" panel on the left of the page.</para>

              <para><emphasis role="bold">Freeform diagram (transient)</emphasis>: when selecting
                this type, a new page of KinOath will open, with a central, blank panel and a
                smaller panel on the top called <emphasis role="bold">Kin Type Strings</emphasis>.
                Also here you can create diagrams from scratch but the difference from the previous
                case is that you need to enter strings in the panel on the top of the page, using
                precise kin types definitions. Hereinafter there is a list of the principal ones
                (which can be found following the path: "Panels" > "Diagram Settings" > "Kin Type
                Definitions"):</para>
              <para>E = ego; Ef = ego female; Em = ego male; x = undefined</para>
              <para>F or Fa = father; M or Mo = mother; P or Pa = parent</para>

              <para>* = first-degree relatives </para>
              <para>Besides the mere kin type definitions, however, you can also add labels to the
                entities, such as names and dates. To do so, you have first to enter a colomn after
                the kin type definition and then the label(s). Different labels belonging to the
                same entity need to be separated by a semi-colomn. Another colomn goes after the
                last label and before the (if any) following kin type definition (see figure below). </para>

                useful when you want to observe how social relations develop and are named within a
                given language and culture. When you choose this diagram a new page of KinOath
                opens, with a central, blank panel, and a smaller panel on the right called
                  <emphasis role="bold">Kin Term Group</emphasis>. In the latter, you can see a
                table that has to be filled in order to create the diagram: in the first column
                  (<emphasis role="bold">Kin Term</emphasis>) you have to enter, as the name itself
                says, the kin terms that will represent also the labels of the entities in the
                diagram; in the second column (<emphasis role="bold">Referent Kin Type
                  Strings</emphasis>) you have to enter, for each kin term, its corresponding
                definition following the ones listed in the "Freeform Diagram"; in the fourth
                  column(<emphasis role="bold">Description</emphasis>) you can add, for example, an
                English gloss if the kin terms entered are in another language. In addition, you can
                decide to: a) show the kin terms on the diagram, or hide them, by checking or
                unckecking the option <emphasis role="bold">Show on graph</emphasis>, above the
                table; b) show or hide the entire diagram by checking or unchecking the option
                  <emphasis role="bold">Generate Example Entities</emphasis>, on the right of "Show
                on Graph"; c) delete some of the kin terms entered in the table by checking them and
                then clicking on <emphasis role="bold">Delete Selected</emphasis>, or delete the
                entire group by simply clicking on <emphasis role="bold">Delete Group</emphasis>, on
                the left of "Delete Selected". [Note: a further option is available: <emphasis
                  role="bold">Propositus Kin Type Strings</emphasis>, which has to do with the fact
                that in some cultures, and therefore in some languages, A talks with B about C with
                different terms, according to the relation existing between B and C. Anyway, for
                this first version of KinOath this option will be hidden]</para>
